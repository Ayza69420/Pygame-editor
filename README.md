# Pygame visualizer

Made to help you create UI using pygame in python, gonna add way more to this project.

Mainly based on your keyboard, as everything is based on hotkeys. However, you need your mouse to scale and move objects around.

# How to run

All you gotta do is run the "main.py" file in the main folder. When done using the program, all the objects information will be stored in the "info.txt" file automatically, however if you wanna save the states of each object, you can use the S hotkey to save as listed below in the hotkeys.
